# Denoise_CCFs
We use two local attributes and a fast solver for local crosscorrelation to denoise the ambient noise CCFs for short-period/high-frequency recording, like a nodal array or DAS

# How to use

The current version is based on Madagascar (https://www.reproducibility.org/wiki/Main_Page) and Noisepy (https://github.com/chengxinjiang/NoisePy)

# Other requirement

OpenMPI
