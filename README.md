# Denoise_CCFs
We use two local attributes and a fast solver for local crosscorrelation to denoise the ambient noise CCFs for short-period/high-frequency recording, like a nodal array or DAS

Please kindly cite our paper by Bin He, David Lumley and Hejun Zhu, Improving signal-to-noise ratios of ambient noise cross-correlation functions using local attributes, 2024, Geophysical Journal International, ggae228, https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggae228.


# How to use

The current version is based on Madagascar (https://www.reproducibility.org/wiki/Main_Page) and Noisepy (https://github.com/chengxinjiang/NoisePy)
